# Video Disclaimer and Information Overlay

This Python script uses the MoviePy library to overlay a disclaimer and information text on a video. The script loads a video clip, adds a text overlay, and then produces a new video with the added information.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- MoviePy library

## Installation
```bash
pip install moviepy

```

## Usage
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed.
Replace the file path in VideoFileClip() with the path to your video file.
Customize the disclaimer text in the text variable.
Adjust font, font size, and other parameters as needed.
Run the script.
## Disclaimer Text
The disclaimer text is intended to provide information and set expectations for viewers. It covers the accuracy of information, professional advice, and the creators' limitations of responsibility.

## Script Explanation
Load the video clip using MoviePy.
Create a TextClip with the disclaimer text.
Crop the video to a specified width.
Set the position and duration of the text clip.
Composite the text clip on top of the video clip.
Write the resulting video to a new file ("output.mp4").
## Notes
The script assumes you have the MoviePy library installed.
Make sure to customize the file paths and text according to your needs.
Feel free to modify the script and disclaimer text based on your specific requirements.
